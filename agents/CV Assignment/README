Part 1. # Describe your approach here
Classify foilage first performs a median filter on the input image, with the intent of smoothing out "salt-and-pepper" noise.
Then, it converts the image to the HSV color space. At this point, we used the provided filterColor.py to try out different HSV
thresholds. Once we messed with the thresholds to get a stasfactory result of masking out non-foilage pixels, we saved the
values by hard coding them in a python array. Then, we used the inRange function to generate a mask with the same dimensions 
as the original image. Finally, we performed another median blur on the mask to get rid of any stray pixels that made it 
past the thresholding but were not likely to be a part of foilage.
